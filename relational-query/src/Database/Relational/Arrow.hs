-- This module defines arrow version combinators which
-- improves type-safty on building queries.
-- Referencing the local projected records may cause to break
-- the result query.
-- It is possible to controls injection of previous local projected records
-- by restricting domain type of arrow. This idea is imported from Opaleye:
--
--   * <https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye>
--   * <https://github.com/khibino/haskell-relational-record/issues/19>
--
-- Importing this module instead of "Database.Relational.Query" enables
-- to build query using arrow combinators.
